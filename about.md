I am Vivek Bharadwaj!

I am a current Comp. Sci. Masters student at Univ. of Southern Calif. Being a full-time student, I live in Los Angeles and yes it **really** is a city of angels. I will be writing about some techinical topics that pop to my head and share some of my experiences being a software engineer and student.
Check out some of my projects on [github][github-profile] and my thoughts on [this site][blog-page-link].

Feel free to [hit me up][contact-me-page] and let me know your thoughts.
