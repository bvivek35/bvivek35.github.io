Hi there, I am Vivek a current Comp. Sci. Masters student at Univ. of Southern Calif. I will be writing about some techinical topics that pop to my head and share some of my experiences being a software engineer and student.

Check out some of my projects on [github][github-profile] and [reach out][contact-link] to me with your thoughts.
Hopefully, this turns out well * fingers crossed *.

Au Revoir
